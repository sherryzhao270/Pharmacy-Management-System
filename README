# Pharmacy Management Project

A web app to help managing the pharmacy system by recording the data and trajectories of various drugs.

Our team used PostgreSQL as the database management system, and pgAdmin 4 was used as the development platform to edit and test queries.

To run the web project, 

1. Run the tables.sql and insert_values.sql in pgAdmin 4 query editor.

2. Connect the database to the application by changing the line 78-87 in setting.py

3. python3 manage.py runserver
